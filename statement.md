# STATEMENT TO COMMUNITY

To The EOS Token Holder Community,

As the launch of EOS nears, speculation within the community concerning competing EOS mainnet launches has increased. As one of many Block Producers across the world responsible for organizing and launching the EOS mainnet, we would like to put the community at ease and declare our intent for the following:

We, EOSVibes, do hereby pledge to present to the community one chain which fully honours the EOS token distribution for their validation. We further agree that we will support calling this validated chain the EOS mainnet, exclusively and definitively.

We publish this letter in concert with following Block Producer candidates from the global community:


Sincerely,

EOSVibes & The EOS Block Producer Community
